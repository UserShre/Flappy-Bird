# Flappy Bird - Web (Canvas)

How to run:
1. Put the files into a new folder.
2. Place your sprite sheet at `assets/sprites.png`. If your sprite coordinates differ, edit `SPRITES` in `main.js`.
3. Serve the folder (recommended) or open index.html in a modern browser.

Example to serve with a simple server:
- Python 3: `python -m http.server 8080`
- Node: `npx serve .`

Features:
- Canvas-based Flappy Bird clone
- Local highscore saved to localStorage
- Placeholder for world-record/leaderboard (requires a remote endpoint)

To push into your GitHub repo:
- Initialize repo locally if needed:
  - `git init`
  - `git remote add origin https://github.com/UserShre/Flappy-Bird.git`
- Create branch and commit:
  - `git checkout -b add-flappy-game`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Add web Flappy Bird (canvas)"`
- Push branch:
  - `git push origin add-flappy-game`

If your GitHub repository is empty (it currently is), you'll need to initialize it or set the remote as above. If you'd like, I can provide a zipped project for you to upload.
